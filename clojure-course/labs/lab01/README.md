# lab01 Clojure and the REPL

Welcome to the Clojure Training Lab number 1! This lab is designed to let you setup your environment and make sure you're able to complete a basic edit of a simple Clojure file. If you never used emacs this is a good time to try out its features. Along with the simple list of shortcuts in the slides, also consider this nice cheatsheet:

## What to try

* Open file lab01/src/hello.clj
* Update the function with your name
* Save and compile
* Switch to namespace hello in REPL
* Run your function
* Have fun!
