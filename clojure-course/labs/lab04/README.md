# lab04 Clojure and the REPL

Welcome to the Clojure Training Lab number 4! This lab is designed to let you experiment with your namespaces or 3rd parties namespace that you want to include.

## Exercise

You've just created a brand new project and the src/lab04/core.clj file is ready to host your great coding skills. You've just coded the execute function and suddenly realize that:

1. it's using the function sanitize from the util namespace.
2. it's using the upper-case function from the clojure.string namespace.

Please fix the problems.
