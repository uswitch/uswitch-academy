# lab03 Clojure Data Structures

Welcome to the Clojure Training Lab number 3 about Clojure data structures! In this lab you're requested to work on two simple exercises.
You can stay at the REPL or you can use src/lab03/core.clj to work on your answers.

## Exercise 1

Create a list of numbers and keep only the even numbers (remember range and even?).

## Exercise 2

Create a list of people and then:

* increment their age,
* select only the women,
* remove the people older than x,
* display only their name and surname

What data structure would you use in this case? Please provide some working code to perform the described operations.
