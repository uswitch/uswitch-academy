## UA Uswitch Academy initiative

### Few ideas floating around at the moment

* multi-disciplinary 1-3 weeks long course for new hire with limited experience (2-3 years) who would otherwise not be able to join uSwitch. Goal: hire additional people and being ready with an internal infrastructure ready to prepare them without disrupting teams.
* single discipline courses on several subjects (programming and operations), open to external public (CV based admission?). Goals: further attract people with a desire to learn to uSwitch and get to know potential hire prospects.

* What about grads? Can we hire some?
* Underrepresented groups in tech, can we attract more? How?

Current TODO:

* selection of people interested in teaching a course/coaching between verticals and disciplines: programming (different languages), operations (how to run networks and infrastructures), business.
* One or two coordinators for operations of course, logistic and so on.
* Line up of potential program and effort, estimate of costs (in time) for people involved and return of value.
* Proposal for review.

Sparse thoughts:

* This is not spare time. It comes with a cost and the first step is to present this cost up-front (along with an idea of the return of investment).
* Suppose we want to be able to sustain one 2 weeks course/coaching per month. If we are 10 people in the pool, thatâ€™s roughly 1 day each per month. Then of course someone will be busier one month more than others.
