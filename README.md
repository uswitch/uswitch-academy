## UA Uswitch Academy initiative

### Few ideas floating around at the moment

* multi-disciplinary 1-3 weeks long course for new hire with limited experience (2-3 years) who would otherwise not be able to join uSwitch. Goal: hire additional people and being ready with an internal infrastructure ready to prepare them without disrupting teams.
* single discipline courses on several subjects (programming and operations), open to external public (CV based admission?). Goals: further attract people with a desire to learn to uSwitch and get to know potential hire prospects.

### Tangential but related

* What about grads? Can we risk some %?

For all goals:

* selection of people interested in teaching a course between verticals and disciplines: programming (different languages), operations (how to run networks and infrastructures), business.
* One or two coordinators for operations of course, logistic and so on.
* Estimate of costs (in time) for people involved and return of value.
* Proposal for Mike to review and approve.
